Hola!

I am Anirudh , a MITACS fellowship masters student at MILA (University of Montreal), passionate about Artificial and Natural intelligence. 
In the past five years, I have worked on Reinforcement learning, Vison, Meta-RL, Imitation learning, Bayesian inference, and Domain adaptation applied to model data from videogames, human brain imaging, and robotics. 

I am doing my masters research with [Dr. Karim Jerbi](https://mila.quebec/en/person/karim-jerbi/) and [Dr. Pierre Bellec](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/team.html) on [Courtious neuromod Project](https://www.cneuromod.ca/). I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science at Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani, India and my Bachelor's thesis at Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems,Tubingen, Germany under Dr. Falk Lieder.
