Hola!

I am Anirudh, currently working with HHMI Janelia Research institute at the intersection of AI and Neuroscience.
I completed my Master's as a MITACS fellowship student at MILA (University of Montreal), and bachelors from BITS Pilani, India. 
Previously worked on Reinforcement Learning, Vision, Meta-RL, Imitation learning, and Domain adaptation applied to model data from video games, human brain imaging, and robotics. 
Love to talk about anything Neuro/ AI !!
Thanks for dropping by!
